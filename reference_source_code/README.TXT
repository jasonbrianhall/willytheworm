This program, while several years old, is still as interesting
to me as it was when I found it.  Reading the source code told
me something about how programs can be made faster.  This program
is able to accept input *much* faster than the Turbo Pascal 
version 3 routines would allow.  It also shows that Pascal is a
valid language to write games that require fast response.

The games screens are all changeable using the screen editor.
If you have comments or questions about this program, they may
be mailed to the author (if he's still around) or sent by
