          Interesting features:
          Willy the Worm is a fast,  challenging arcade style game with
          the following special features:
               *  Fully compatible with IBM PC and PCjr
               *  Color and sound effects are supported but optional
               *  Not one or two but EIGHT game screens
               *  Editor included for customizing the game screens
               *  Top ten high scores and names are saved on disk
          Starting the game:
          To start the game,  just enter 'WILLY'  at  the  DOS  prompt.
          Answer the two questions (color and sound used) with 'Y'  for
          'Yes' or 'N' for 'No'.  After that,  the title screen will be
          displayed with some basic instructions.
          Playing the game:
          The object of the game is to reach  the  bell  without  being
          squashed  by  a  cannonball  or  running  out of time.  Extra
          points may be earned by getting presents along the way and by
          jumping over the balls.  After you reach the bell you will be
          awarded points for the remaining time and you will advance to
          the next screen.
          The game is played with the four arrow keys to make Willy the
          Worm run left and right and climb ladders up  and  down,  and
          the spacebar to make him jump. (Note that when jumping, Willy
          can change directions  in  mid-air.  This  can  be  extremely
          useful!)  Any  other  key  makes  him  stop.  On  the  PC,  a
          convenient stop key is the '5' on the numeric keypad  and  on
          the  PCjr  DEL  works  well.  To exit to DOS during the game,
          please use ESC rather than  CTRL-C  because  this  will  save
          changes to the high score list before leaving.
          If  you  find  this  game  too  hard (or too easy),  read the
          EDWILLY.DOC file and use the screen editor to  make  it  suit
          your fancy.  You can also use the editor to get a preview and
          practice on the higher levels.
          Scoring:
          The  bonus  counter is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
          It starts at 1000 and counts down by tens.  When you finish a
          level,  the remaining bonus is added to your  score.  If  the
          bonus  gets  to 0,  you lose a worm and start the level over.
          Jumping over one or more balls earns  20  points.  Getting  a
          present  is 100 points.  After the game,  the high scores are
          displayed in two lists.  The  'Daily  Pinworms'  list  resets
          each  time  you  enter  the  program,   while  the  'All-Time
          Nightcrawlers' list is saved on disk.
          If you damage a file:
          The batch file RESTORE.BAT will copy hidden backup copies  of
          all  the files required by WIlly the Worm and the game screen
          editor.   These   are:   WILLY.COM,   WILLY.SCR,   WILLY.DAT,
          WILLY.CHR,  and  EDWILLY.COM.  Be warned that this will over-
          write  changes  to the screens and the high score list.  This
          batch file uses  the  two  utility  programs  on  this  disk,
          VIS.COM and INVIS.COM,  which make directory entries  visible
          and  invisible,  respectively.  The syntax for these commands
          is (IN)VIS filename.  Paths may be used but wild  card  char-
          acters may not.
          MAKING DONATIONS
          You've heard it all before: "The development of this software
          has taken much time and effort.  If we are  to  continue  our
          production of user-supported software, your contributions are
          vital."  Well,  I can tell you first-hand that it's true.  If
          enough people send ten dollars,  maybe I'll  find  it  in  my
          heart to write "Willy The Worm II" or "Pete the Pigeon".
          Hint: If you like this game a LOT, you can send more than ten
          dollars!
          Have gobs of fun and don't forget to pass copies on to all of
          your friends!
